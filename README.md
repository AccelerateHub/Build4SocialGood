## How to Submit Your Project!

### Step 0
Fork this repo

### Step 1
Clone that fork to your desktop.

### Step 2
Create a branch named after your project.

### Step 3
In the repo, there is one folder for each prize category. Open the folder that corresponds with the category you are submitting against.

### Step 4
In the prize category folder, *create a new subfolder for your team's project.*

### Step 5
Name the subfolder your project name.

### Step 6
Submit the following in your project's folder:
- Submission.md template
- A single file that pitches the product (video, PDF, deck)
- All supporting material (code, research, designs etc)

All submissions, including all code, must be open source for future use and reference by the community, and links to external documents must be provided in the Github repo submission.

As a reminder, we are looking for projects that address a real problem and teams that have shown the progress and entrepreneurial instincts to make something real and get it out in the world. Your application should communicate this. The more compelling the presentation, the better your team does!

### Step 7
Fill out the `submission.md` template, included at the top of each prize category folder with all relevant information.

**This must be included to be considered for the winning prize.**

### Step 8
Create a pull request with your team's folder submission to be merged into Master. Submit it to the repo.

## How to Submit Your Project!

### Step 0
Fork this repo

### Step 1
Clone that fork to your desktop.

### Step 2
Create a branch named after your project.

### Step 2
In the repo, there is one folder for each bounty. Open the folder that corresponds with the bounty you are submitting against.

### Step 3
In the bounty's folder, *create a new subfolder for your team's project.*

### Step 3
Name the subfolder your project name.

### Step 4
Submit the following in your project's folder:
- Submission.md template
- A single file that pitches the product (video, PDF, deck)
- All supporting material (code, research, designs etc)

All submissions, including all code, must be open source for future use and reference by the community, and links to external documents must be provided in the Github repo submission.

As a reminder, we are looking for projects that address a real problem and teams that have shown the progress and entrepreneurial instincts to make something real and get it out in the world. Your application should communicate this. _The more compelling the presentation, the better your team does!_

### Step 5
Fill out the submission.md template, included at the top of the bounty's folder with all relevant information.

**This must be included to be considered for the bounty prize.**

### Step 6
Create a pull request with your team's folder submission to be merged into Master. Submit it to the repo.
